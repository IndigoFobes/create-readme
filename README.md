# README.md Creator

## Description

This application helps users create a README file that looks professional and organized. It is easy to use and saves the user time that they can instead use finishing up their own application. 

This was my first node.js/command line application, so I learned quite a bit about using the fileSystem module and the Inquirer package. The tools used for this application are Javascript, Inquirer, and Node.js. And Screencastify for the attached screen recording.

  ## Usage

  To use the README.md Creator, make sure you've installed inquirer and have the required package-lock.json file included in your folder.

  Once you have everything installed, in your terminal, cd into the Develop folder and type 'node index.js'. You will be prompted to answer a series of questions. Your answers will be used to create a customized readme for you project. Once you have answered all of the questions, your README.md file will appear in your folder!
